##  formatdown  <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

Formatting tools for R markdown documents. 

Provides a small set of tools for common formatting tasks when writing documents in R Markdown or Quarto Markdown. Works with outputs in html, pdf, docx and possibly others. Currently only one function, though I plan to include additional functions as needed to support repetitive formatting tasks as they arise in my projects, e.g. my blog (.qmd files) or R package vignettes (.Rmd files). 

*Format powers of ten.* &nbsp; Convert a numerical vector in E-notation (*mEn*) to a character vector in base-10 power notation $(m \times 10^n)$, where $m$ is the *significand* (or *coefficient*) in decimal form and $n$ is the *exponent* [@Kahan:2002]. 

- In *E-notation* form and  *scientific* form, the exponent is an integer and the significand usually lies in the range $1 \leq m < 10$. 
- In *engineering* form, the exponent is an *integer multiple of three* and  the resulting significand lies in the range $1 \leq m < 1000$.


```{r}
#| include: false
library("formatdown")
x <- 101100
```

For example, suppose we have a pressure reading `r paste0("$p =$", format_power(x, 4))` kPa. In the three types of notation mentioned, the value would be rendered as follows: 

| Type        | Rendered as                                     | 
|:------------|------------------------------------------------:|
| E-notation  | `r formatC(x, format = "E")` Pa                 |
| scientific  | `r format_power(x, 4, engr_notation = FALSE)` Pa|
| engineering | `r format_power(x, 4)` Pa                       |







## Usage

```{r}
library("formatdown")
```


### `format_power()`

Operates on a numerical vector to produce a character vector with each element delimited by `$...$` to render as in-line mathematics in R markdown and Quarto markdown documents. 

```{r}
#| collapse: true
format_power(101100, sig_dig = 4)
```

In an Rmd output, this string prints as: `r format_power(101100, sig_dig = 4)`. We can switch to scientific notation by resetting the engineering notation flag.

```{r}
#| collapse: true
format_power(101100, sig_dig = 4, engr_notation = FALSE)
```

In an Rmd output, this string prints as: `r format_power(101100, 4, engr_notation = FALSE)`. Because the output in all cases is type character, the `\` symbol in the LaTeX product symbol `\times` has to be escaped, that is, `\\times`. 







## Installation

Not yet available from CRAN.  The development version can be installed from GitHub.

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("graphdr/formatdown")
```







## Requirements

- <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> (\>= 3.5.0)

## Contributing

To contribute to formatdown,

- Please clone this repo locally.  
- Commit your contribution on a separate branch.
- If you submit a function, please use the *checkmate* package to
  include runtime argument checks and the *tinytest* package to write
  unit tests for your code. Save tests in the `inst/tinytest/`
  directory.

To provide feedback or report a bug,

- Use the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/graphdr/formatdown/issues">
    Issues</a> page.
- Please run the package unit tests and report the results with your bug
  report. Any user can run the package tests by installing the
  *tinytest* package and running:

``` r
# Detailed test results
test_results <- tinytest::test_package("formatdown")
as.data.frame(test_results)
```
